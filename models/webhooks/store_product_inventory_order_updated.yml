      Fires to indicate changes in inventory through an order for a _base product_. The webhook fires for products with or without variants, but only when you track by _product_.

      A store's [inventory settings](/docs/rest-management/settings/inventory#get-inventory-settings) affect _when_ stock levels change through an order. For example, stock levels can change when you either place or complete/ship an order. Stock levels can also change when you refund or cancel an order.
