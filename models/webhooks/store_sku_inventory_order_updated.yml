      Fires to indicate changes in _variant_ inventory through an order. The webhook fires only for products with variants, and you must track by _variant_.
      
      A store's [inventory settings](/docs/rest-management/settings/inventory#get-inventory-settings) affect _when_ stock levels change through an order. For example, stock levels can change when you either place or complete/ship an order. Stock levels can also change when you refund or cancel an order.
