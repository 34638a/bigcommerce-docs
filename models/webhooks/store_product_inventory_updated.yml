      Fires to indicate changes in inventory for a _base product_. For products with variants, you must track by _product_ and change _product-level_ inventories. For products without variants, the webhook fires regardless of how you track inventory.
 
      Inventory updates from APIs, marketplace apps, and control panel trigger the webhook. In the control panel, you can bulk import inventories or navigate to the **Products > View** tab.
