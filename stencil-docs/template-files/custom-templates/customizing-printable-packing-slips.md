## Customizing Printable Packing Slips

Customizing your Stencil theme's printable packing slips currently relies on a template and variables from BigCommerce's legacy Blueprint themes framework. Here are the steps:

1. Download [this printable packing slip .zip file](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/template-files/packing_slip_printable.zip), which contains the skeleton of a printable packing slip.

2. Make your customizations to the HTML file.

3. Set your theme's checkout type to Custom one-page checkout (for developers).

4. [Use WebDAV](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/File-Access-WebDAV/) to upload your customized HTML file to WebDAV's `/template/` folder<sup>1</sup>.

5. Once you have completed the above steps, you are free to switch your theme's checkout type to
`One-page checkout` or `Optimized one-page checkout`.
