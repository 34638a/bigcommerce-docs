## Layout Subdirectory

The <span class="fn">/templates/layout/</span> subdirectory is where you assemble Handlebars resources to define your storefront siteâ€™s overall structure (header, footer, etc.). You can implement multiple layouts here for different use cases, making it easy to switch between different look-and-feel variations of the same theme.

As prototypes, we have provided a minimal <span class="fn"><a href="https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/templates/layout/base.html">base.html</a></span> page in this subdirectory. To develop your theme, you can copy and/or modify this prototype.

Be sure to set permission `755 (drwxr-xr-x)` on any new **subdirectories** that you add. Also, be sure to set permission `644 (rw-r--r--)` on any new **files** that you add. Without these permissions, running your theme locally will fail with multiple error messages. Bundling your theme will also fail, blocking its upload to a store.
