**Coming Soon**
# BigCommerce Public Developer Documentation

On December 27th, 2023, the following public documentation repositories will be deprecated, and all documentation will move into this repository. These repositories will then become read-only:

* `https://github.com/bigcommerce/api-specs`
* `https://github.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs`
* `https://github.com/bigcommerce/theme-context-object-schemas`

If you maintain API clients, this repository will be your source for the most up-to-date API specifications.

The BigCommerce DX team is excited to create a new consolidated GitHub home for our documentation. We look forward to offering a more streamlined developer experience, starting December 27th!
